<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Dev Lulla, a second-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. 
  I have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms (DSA) and enjoy using these skills to design efficient and scalable solutions.
  Proficient in multiple programming languages, I thrive on learning new technologies and applying them to real-world challenges.
</p>

<p>
  As a driven and curious individual, I'm always seeking opportunities to grow as a developer.
  I'm particularly interested in collaborating on projects that push boundaries and make a meaningful impact.
  Currently, I'm actively looking for a co-op opportunity where I can contribute my knowledge, gain hands-on experience, and work alongside like-minded professionals.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new ideas, learning about the latest tech trends, or refining my skills through personal projects.
  Let's connect and build something extraordinary together!
